# Codecademy_Biodiversity
The third portfolio project from the Codecademy Data Science Foundations Skill Path. This project analyses data from the National Parks Service, around various species observed at different park locations.

The project answers the following questions: 
- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?
